							<p>Trekking is similar to Meditation. When you climb up to a mountain peak, it somehow calms you down. You are with yourself for that brief moment and there is no other feeling
                that can match that calmness and nearness to oneself.

Trekking in India started when the land was inhabited in prehistoric times. There are perhaps as many trekking routes in India as there are Indians. It was in the 1970’s and 1980’s that trekking
started gaining in popularity as a recreational/adventure sport. A number of religious sites and shrines across the country, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, and in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand
– such as Badrinath, Amarnath, Gangotri, Hemkund, Joshimath, Kedarnath, Vaishno Devi and Yamunotri – entail trekking for a couple of days in the mountains. Trekking in India has grown in
leaps and bounds and the current trekking scenario is very promising, with thousands of Indians and foreigners hitting trekking trails each year.

What India can boast of is some of the most stunning trekking routes in the world – many of the mountain passes in the Ladakh and Zanskar Himalayas are above 5000m. There are plenty of gentler
and smaller trails, at different altitudes, both in the mountains and in the forests. You’ll find plenty in in the Western Ghats and the Nilgiri Hills
of south India(Munnar and Wayanad in Kerala, Coorg in Karnataka and Ooty in Tamil Nadu).<br></p>

campsites under the starry sky while you wit for Moonrise and creates the most beautiful mornings.Trekking for us is not about rushing to the peak, it is about enjoying every step of
the way we pack grocery to cook on mountains, swim in the river and streams while we let the fish nibble on our feet. Conversations about more travel, more mountains is what we crave for.
